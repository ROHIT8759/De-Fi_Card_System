# Security & Performance Audit Report

## ðŸ”’ Security Analysis

### Current Vulnerabilities
- **High Severity**: 6 vulnerabilities found in Aptos wallet dependencies
- **Root Cause**: Outdated axios versions in @aptos-labs packages
- **Risk Level**: Medium (vulnerabilities are in dependencies, not direct usage)

### Security Improvements Implemented
âœ… **Input Sanitization**: Added security utilities in `src/utils/security.js`
âœ… **Error Boundaries**: Added React error boundary component
âœ… **CSP Configuration**: Content Security Policy setup
âœ… **API Whitelist**: Restricted API endpoints

### Recommended Actions
1. **Monitor Aptos Updates**: Check for newer wallet adapter versions regularly
2. **Environment Variables**: Store sensitive data in environment variables
3. **HTTPS Only**: Ensure production deployment uses HTTPS
4. **Regular Audits**: Run `npm audit` weekly

## âš¡ Performance Optimizations

### Implemented Optimizations
âœ… **React Optimizations**:
   - Added `useCallback` for event handlers
   - Added `useMemo` for expensive calculations
   - Optimized re-renders with proper dependencies

âœ… **CSS Optimizations**:
   - GPU acceleration with `transform: translateZ(0)`
   - Responsive grid sizing for mobile
   - Reduced motion support for accessibility
   - Background attachment optimization

âœ… **Code Structure**:
   - Error boundary for better error handling
   - Performance utilities for future use
   - Modular component architecture

### Mobile Responsiveness
âœ… **Navbar**: Responsive padding and font sizes
âœ… **Grid Background**: Smaller grid size on mobile (20px vs 40px)
âœ… **Touch Optimization**: Proper touch targets and hover states
âœ… **Performance**: Optimized background attachment for mobile

### Performance Utilities Created
- **Debounce function** for search inputs
- **Lazy loading** for images
- **Memory monitoring** (development only)
- **Virtual scrolling** for large lists
- **Resource preloader** for critical assets

## ðŸ“± Mobile Optimizations

### Responsive Design
- Adaptive navbar spacing (4px mobile, 20px desktop)
- Flexible font sizes (xl mobile, 2xl desktop)
- Mobile-first grid pattern (20px mobile, 40px desktop)
- Optimized touch interactions

### Performance on Mobile
- Background attachment: `scroll` on mobile (better performance)
- Reduced grid opacity on mobile (better readability)
- Default cursor fallback on mobile devices
- Optimized animations for touch devices

## ðŸ›  Build Optimizations

### Bundle Analysis
- Vite build analyzer configured
- Code splitting with lazy loading ready
- Tree shaking enabled by default
- Modern JavaScript output

### Development Experience
- Hot reload optimized
- Error boundaries prevent crashes
- Performance monitoring in development
- Security audit scripts added

## ðŸš€ Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. **Test thoroughly** on mobile devices
2. **Monitor performance** in production
3. **Set up environment variables** for API keys
4. **Configure HTTPS** for production

### Future Improvements
1. **Implement virtual scrolling** for large coin lists
2. **Add service worker** for offline capability
3. **Optimize images** with next-gen formats
4. **Add performance monitoring** tools

### Security Monitoring
1. **Weekly npm audits**: `npm run security:audit`
2. **Dependency updates**: Keep Aptos packages updated
3. **Environment security**: Secure API keys and endpoints
4. **Content Security Policy**: Implement in production

## ðŸ“Š Performance Metrics

### Target Metrics
- **First Contentful Paint**: < 1.5s
- **Largest Contentful Paint**: < 2.5s
- **Cumulative Layout Shift**: < 0.1
- **First Input Delay**: < 100ms

### Current Optimizations
- Efficient re-renders with React hooks
- Optimized CSS animations
- Responsive images and backgrounds
- Minimal JavaScript bundles
